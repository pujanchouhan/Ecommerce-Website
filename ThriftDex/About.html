                We aim at providing the Indian GenZ with the coolest clothing at affordable prices without compromising on quality!
                
                Originated in 2024 by Pujan Chouhan, Thriftdex India provides the urban GenZ with their style necessities. What started as a small venture to offer stylish merchandise for Pujan's Instagram followers quickly turned into a popular fashion destination.
                
                Thriftdex India brings you second-hand clothes imported from fashion-forward countries like South Korea, Japan, and Thailand. These countries are renowned for their unique and trendy street styles. Our curated collections are sourced from international university students, ensuring you get the latest in global fashion trends. Whether it’s oversized hoodies, stylish jackets, or quirky T-shirts, every piece has a story and offers you a slice of international style.
                
                We understand the fast-paced lives of GenZ and their desire to always look fashionable without burning a hole in their pockets.

Wherever you go, Thriftdex ensures you are always dressed in style. These are not just clothes, they are NEEDS!
